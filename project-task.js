// ============================================
// ‚úÖ Requirements
// ============================================

/*
- Use a JSON validator or linter (e.g., https://jsonlint.com/) to test your final version
- Keep track of each fix:
  ‚Ä¢ What was wrong?
  ‚Ä¢ Why is it a problem in JSON?
  ‚Ä¢ What did you change to fix it?
*/


// ============================================
// ü§î Follow-Up Questions
// ============================================

/*
üí¨ Reflect and answer the following:

1Ô∏è‚É£ What tools or techniques did you use to identify the errors?
general knowledge of JSON syntax and Linter to verify

2Ô∏è‚É£ How did you confirm that your corrected JSON file was valid?
JSONLint

3Ô∏è‚É£ Which errors were the most difficult to spot? Why?

4Ô∏è‚É£ What strategies can help you avoid these kinds of errors in the future?
   (e.g., syntax highlighting, linters, writing JSON by example)
   VS code highlighting (and also the auto-input of closing punctuation) is very helpful in a JSON file.   I couldn't figure out how to leave this as JSON and also include my responses as comments within the code.

   JSONLint was easy to use and pointed out issues.
